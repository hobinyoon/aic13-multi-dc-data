Once you've collected the YCSB output, remove the numerous R-TS and W-TS entries
with the following one-liner bash script:

tmp=$(mktemp) && for f in is*; do grep -v [RW]-TS $f > $tmp && cp $tmp $f; done

Store them in baseline/<config>/ [TODO or some failure subdir]

After filtering the [RW]-TS lines from YCSB output files, extract the timeseries
data into machine-parseable tables with:

./extract-bulk.sh baseline/n8_rep6 plots/baseline/n8_rep6

Plot each of the individual tables created above with:

./plot-bulk.sh plots/baseline/n8_rep6 plots/baseline/n8_rep6/plots

Please do not check in the output of extract.sh or extract-bulk.sh, or any PDFs.

You may modify the plot parameters by changing the script variables in
plot-bulk.sh or by directly executing plot.sh on the individual file you would
like. Each script emits usage information if you execute it without any
arguments (except extract.sh, see the top of the file).

To get a feel for what values to use for the y-axis and x-axis ranges, run:

./display-min-max.sh plots/baseline/n8_rep6

Use these values to fix the axes ranges across all bulk-plotted graphs.
