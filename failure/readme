Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains scripts and experiment data for runnin YCSB on Cassandra
varying the replication factor while introducing "failures" in the system (i.e.
Cassandra nodes become unresponsive).

cli and ycsb scripts assume Cassandra and YCSB to be installed to specific
paths. To run the scripts, either install Cassandra and YCSB into the assumed
places or just change the scripts to point to them.

Failure Models
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Failure' defined here to mean pausing the JVM instance hosting the Cassandra
daemon. Signals SIGSTOP and SIGCONT issued to the process to simulate
recoverable failures, i.e. complete node failures not represented, as these
would imply empty state on resumption - failure wipes disks.

Cluster consists of N nodes. First node is the only seed. Non-seed nodes are
'failed' (as failing the seed results in all Cassandra instances unable to
interact).

It takes ~30s for the seed to register a node as 'down' after SIGSTOP is issued.
Once SIGCONT is issued, the seed immediately registers the node as 'alive' once
again.

---- Policies ----

F0
    Let YCSB stabilize for 120s. Fail one node. Wait 120s.
    Resume node. Wait 120s. Repeat on same node.
F1
    Let YCSB stabilize for 60. Fail one node. Wait 15s.
    Resume node. Wait 60s. Repeat on same node.
